### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I have been interested in aspects of human language for the past half century. Given the interest, it is only too natural for me to get a Ph.D. degree in linguistics and get a teaching position in a University.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning neural network models of language processing in my spare time and find it interesting as well.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m working on building models like Word2Vec, GPT-2, and BERT, which work for the Korean language.
- ðŸ¤” My short term goal is to build an accurate word-segmenter for the Korean language, which I think is essential to the performance of Korean Processing systems.
